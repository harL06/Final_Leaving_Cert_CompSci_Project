Model of New York Times' Wordle, my ambitious Python project submitted as my Leaving Certificate Computer Science Project. This repository highlights an array of skills I've developed through the recreation of the Wordle game.

***Project Highlights:***

***User-Friendly Interface:***
Crafted entirely from scratch, the project features an intuitive and visually engaging graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Python plugin PySimpleGUI.

***Three Game Modes:***
Singleplayer: Replicates the official Wordle experience, delivering a challenging word-guessing game.

Multiplayer: Meets the project requirements with a multiplayer mode where participants take turns guessing words, accumulating points, and determining a winner.

***Simulation Mode (Key Feature):*** The standout element offers users the ability to customize simulations, experimenting with game parameters. Notable features include:

***Machine Learning Integration:*** A bot learns and enhances its word-guessing strategy using reinforcement learning algorithms.
Dynamic Q-Value Updates: After each simulation, the bot refines word-ranking based on performance, making smarter choices over time.
Curiosity Control: Users can fine-tune the bot's exploratory behavior and allow it to find new strategies.

***Graphing Mode:***
Beyond gameplay, my model offers a Graphing Mode enabling users to create custom graphs within the GUI. Harnessing data from various game modes, users can generate insightful graphs and save them as named PDFs, all within my custom GUI.
